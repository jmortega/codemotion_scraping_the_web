seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry
Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve
this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in
the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language
to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages
like Scratch.</value><value>The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from
its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive
community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major
Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is
invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the
experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of
teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned
programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with
frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as
usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost
importance.</value><value>In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and
how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further
support from the Python developer community.</value></description><tags><value>python</value></tags><title><value>Keynote: Designed for Education: A Python Solution</value></title></item><item><date><value>Wednesday 22 July</value></date><author><value>Sebastian Neubauer</value></author><description><value>Software development is all about writing code that delivers additional value to a customer. Following the agile and lean approach this value created by code changes should be continuously delivered as fast, as early and as often as possible without any compromise on the quality. 
Remarkably, there is a huge gap between the development of the application code and the reliable and scalable operation of the application. As an example, most of the tutorials about web development with Flask or Django end by starting a local “dummy” server, missing out all the steps needed for production ready operation of the web service. Furthermore, as there is no “rocket science” in-between, many proposals to bridge that gap from both sides, operations and developers start with sentences like: “you just have to…”, a clear indication that it will cause problems later on and also a symptom of a cultural gap between developers and operations staff.
In this talk I will go through the complete delivery pipeline from application development to the industrial grade operation, clearly biased towards the “DevOps” mindset. Instead of presenting a sophisticated enterprise solution, I will outline the necessary building blocks for continuous delivery and fill them up with simple but working poor man’s solutions, so that it is equally useful for professional and non-professional developers and operations engineers. After the talk you will know how to build such a continuous delivery pipeline with open-source tools like “Ansible”, “Devpi” and “Jenkins” and I will share some of my day-to-day experiences with automation in general. Although many of the concepts are language agnostic I will focus on the ins and outs in a python universe and outline the pythonic way of “get this thing running”.</value></description><tags><value>Operations</value><value>ApplicationLifecycle</value><value>ConfigurationManagement</value><value>Devpi</value><value>ContinuousDelivery</value><value>DevOps</value><value>ansible</value><value>Jenkins</value></tags><title><value>A Pythonic Approach to Continuous Delivery</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Cosmin Poieana</value></author><description><value>Bring the continuous integration to a new level, through a platform/project independent framework able to give you unittest-like reports.

More details can be found on the package page: https://github.com/PCManticore/argus-ci.</value><value>The goals of this talk are to show its generic scalability, how simple is to create such kind of recipes, the relationship between scenarios, introspection and tests and, but not last, the unlimited freedom of creating very custom aspects of these entities which lead to relevant and in-depth ready for analysis logs. There are no major prerequisites to understand it, just to be familiar with Python and optionally have a focus on cloud infrastructures.</value></description><tags><value>cloudbase-init</value><value>continuous-integration</value><value>open-source</value><value>windows</value><value>Testing</value><value>argus</value><value>linux</value><value>OpenStack</value><value>devstack</value><value>cloud</value></tags><title><value>Argus - the omniscient CI</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Scott Triglia</value></author><description><value>The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So much so that Yelp’s Transaction Platform committed from the start to an architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the inevitable complications that arise for Python developers in as the services grow larger and stretch both their own architecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of terror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm your heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as we follow the adventures of our plucky team.</value><value>The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to the particular difficulties faced by Python developers trying to implement such systems. My goal is to share with attendees some mistakes we’ve made, some successful methods for growing gracefully, and Python-specific tools/libraries which can help with these problems.</value><value>To enjoy this talk, you should be aware of the basic vocabulary and concepts of HTTP-based services. Any additional awareness of distributed systems (and their failure modes) will be helpful.</value></description><tags><value>services</value><value>distributed-systems</value><value>HTTP</value></tags><title><value>Arrested Development - surviving the awkward adolescence of a microservices-based application</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Naomi Ceder</value></author><description><value>Stop doing the same thing but expecting different results</value><value>As developers we put considerable effort into optimisation. We are always tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove antipatterns from our code and our development processes. </value><value>Yet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit of optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though most people these days agree that, like good tests, agile methodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a “good thing”.</value><value>My position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organisations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these antipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of “culture fit”, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organisations might work to combat them.</value></description><tags><value>Best Practice</value><value>diversity</value><value>community</value><value>inclusion</value></tags><title><value>Antipatterns for Diversity</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Shane Evans</value></author><description><value>Python is a fantastic language for writing web scrapers.

The project was public before that under the name “tulip”. asyncio is just a core network library, it requires third party library to be usable for common protocols. One year later, asyncio has a strong community writing libraries on top of it.</value><value>The most advanced library is aiohttp which includes a complete HTTP client but also a HTTP server. There are also libraries to access asynchronously the file system, resolve names with DNS, have variables local to tasks, read-write locks, etc. There are clients for AMQP, Asterisk, ElasticSearch, IRC, XMPP (Jabber), etc. (and even an IRC server!). There are asynchronous drivers for all common databases, and even for some ORMs. As expected, there are tons of new web frameworks based on asyncio. It’s also possible to plug asyncio into Gtk, Qt, gevent, eventlet, gunicorn, tornado, etc.</value><value>I will also discuss use cases of asyncio in production and benchmarks. Spoiler: asyncio is not slow.</value><value>The asyncio library also evolved to become more usable: it has a better documentation, is easier to debug and has a few new functions. There is also a port to Python 2: trollius.</value></description><tags><value>networking</value><value>aiohttp</value><value>python3</value><value>asyncio</value></tags><title><value>asyncio community, one year later</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Abraham Martin</value></author><description><value>The talk will show the architecture and inners of a cloud hosting service we are developing in the University of Cambridge based on python technologies, mainly django, ansible, and celery.</value><value>The users manage their hosts using a web panel, developed in django, with common options: ability to create a vhost, associate domain names to vhosts, install packages, recover from backups, make snapshots, etc. Interaction between the panel and the hosts are made using ansible playbooks launched asynchronously by celery tasks. The VM architecture has been designed to be VM platform agnostic and to provide disk replication and high availability.</value><value>The University of Cambridge central IT services (http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/) also provides other services to the rest of the university like domain name registration, authentication, authorisation, TLS certificates, etc. We link all these other services with the hosting service by using APIs while keeping a microservices architecture approach.

Python logging can help you.</value><value>This talk you will show you how to implement a systematic logging approach without boilerplate code and how to set up the Python logging module for different needs in production systems.  We will see how to  work with log files and other logging endpoints.  We will address the data protection concerns that come up when logging  from application with personal  information. We will also look at the performance implications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to structure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to configure logging for different use cases.</value><value>We will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.

Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure, but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).
In this talk, I’ll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python code.  Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and the likes, but its true power isn’t always obvious to the eye of beholder.  It can detect simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also detect more complicated cases such as invalid arguments passed to functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes and what special methods aren’t implemented correctly. Starting from abstract syntax trees, we’ll go through its inference engine and we’ll see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and what sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference, including PEP 484 type hints. As a bonus, I’ll show how it can be used to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its new –py3k mode.</value><value>Link to presentation: http://pcmanticore.github.io/pylint-talks/#slide:1</value></description><tags><value>static-analysis</value><value>lint</value><value>typehinting</value><value>ast</value></tags><title><value>12 years of Pylint  (or How I learned to stop worrying about bugs)</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Florian Wilhelm</value></author><description><value>The author  shows how to use the </value><value>SleekXMPP</value><value> library in order to write a small chatbot that connects to Google Hangouts and reminds you or someone else to take medication for instance.

In this talk, I’ll discuss the recent rise of immutable state concepts in languages and network protocols.  And how the advent of hash-based data structures and replication strategies are shaking the client/server web service paradigm which rests on managing mutable state through http.  By contrast, building on git, bittorrent and other content addressed data structures provides for a more secure, efficient decentralized communication topology.   There are projects, thoughts and talk to create new web standards to bring such technologies to mass deployment and fuel a new wave of decentralization.  What can Python bring to the table?   </value></description><tags><value>python</value></tags><title><value>Keynote: Towards a more effective, decentralized web</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Mandy Waite</value></author><description><value>You’ve solved the issue of process-level reproducibility by packaging up
your apps and execution environments into a number of Docker containers.
But once you have a lot of containers running, you’ll probably need to
coordinate them across a cluster of machines while keeping them healthy and
making sure they can find each other. Trying to do this imperatively can
quickly turn into an unmanageable mess! Wouldn’t it be helpful if you could
declare to your cluster what you want it to do, and then have the cluster
assign the resources to get it done and to recover from failures and scale
on demand?
&gt;
Kubernetes (http://kubernetes.io) is an open source, cross platform cluster
management and container orchestration platform that simplifies the complex
tasks of deploying and managing your applications in Docker containers. You
declare a desired state, and Kubernetes does all the work needed to create
and maintain it. In this talk, we’ll look at the basics of Kubernetes and
at how to map common applications to these concepts. This will include a
hands-on demonstration and visualization of the steps involved in getting
an application up and running on Kubernetes.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>docker</value><value>cloud</value></tags><title><value>Keynote: So, I have all these Docker containers, now what?</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Guido van Rossum</value></author><description><value>This is </value><value>your</value><value> keynote!

An EFL pre-compiler translates EFL blocks into parallel Python code.  EFL may be embedded in any host language by writing an appropriate pre-compiler. The EFL pre-compiler is being developed for other host programming languages (C++, Java, C#, Fortran, etc) as well as for other parallel platforms (DTM/MPI4PY, etc. ).

Concurrency is one of those cases when people look for an alternative. It’s actually what happened at the start-up I work at before I joined. The co-founders looked for a solution in a functional programming language and chose to use Clojure. Functional programming is now implemented in most programming languages and functional languages are getting more and more popular. For a junior developer learning a functional language as her/his second programming language completely make sense and I was up for the challenge! Clojure is not so different from Python in its readability and might be one of the easiest functional languages to learn for a Pythonista. I would like to share my tips and tools I used for learning and contributing to a code base in Clojure.</value><value>There are several online resources to understand the paradigm of functional programming. The same can be said regarding Clojure but a good way to learn aside from diving into a codebase is to take part in a community. The Clojurians are much fewer than the Pythonistas but they are equally friendly. They are looking forward to grow their community and their meetups and dojos are well suited to beginners. At some point you have to throw yourself into this sea of parentheses so you’d better be well equipped! In that aim Emacs is by far the best suited text editor. After customising it with the right tools you shall fear no orphan parens!
This experience will help you progress and focus on writing more concise code with short and clear functions. You will be more comfortable and curious about implementing the functional features of the Python language. Getting always closer to the Zen of Python: " Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. ….

This scalable framework can be accessed through a web interface from the strategic marketing and R&amp;D departments and other directive figures; a similar and leaner interface is available for the individual POS owners. The web interface integrates Javascript libraries to obtain interactive displays connecting machine learning and data exploration (D3js, Highcharts, Sigma.js, Heatmap.js, leaflet, InCHlib). In particular we fork the django-highchart repository to improve functionalities available for the Django framework. Actionable dendrogram structures and sunburst plots allow the handling of big taxonomies typical of the category managment reference structures.

Although transducers are actually pretty straightforward in retrospect, wrapping your brain around them can be challenging. </value><value>Transducers allow us to fuse multiple data processing operations together so they can be applied in a single pass over a data series – similar to how Python generator functions allow us to process iterable series.  However, unlike generator functions they are completely decoupled from the data series abstraction and can be used on eager sequences, lazy iterables, coroutine-based push events and events such as those modelled by Reactive Extensions for Python (RxPy). </value><value>In this workshop, we introduce transducers by implementing them from scratch in Python 3. We’ll start with the familiar staples of functional programming, map(), filter() and reduce(), and derive transducers from first principles. We’ll work towards a set of general tools which works with eager collections, lazy ‘pull’ sequences, and coroutine ‘push’ event streams and RxPy. Along the way we’ll cover stateful transducers and transducer composition, demonstrating that transducers are both more general, and more fundamental, than the functional programming tools baked into Python and many other languages.</value><value>There are no prerequisites for this workshop as we stick to core Python 3 language features although an enthusiasm for a functional programming style will be sure to help attendees get the most out of this session.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>fun</value><value>Functional Programming</value><value>functional</value></tags><title><value>Functional Programming with Transducers in Python</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Michael McKerns</value></author><description><value>Highly-constrained, large-dimensional, and non-linear optimizations are found at the root of most of today’s forefront problems in statistics, quantitative finance, risk, operations research, materials design, and other predictive sciences. Tools for optimization, however, have not changed much in the past 40 years – until very recently. The abundance of parallel computing resources has stimulated a shift away from using reduced models to solve statistical and predictive problems, and toward more direct methods for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems.</value><value>This tutorial</value><value> will introduce modern tools for solving optimization problems – beginning with traditional methods, and extending to solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints. We will start by introducing the cost function, and it’s use in local and global optimization. We will then address how to monitor and diagnose your optimization convergence and results, tune your optimizer, and utilize compound termination conditions. This tutorial will discuss building and applying box constraints, penalty functions, and symbolic constraints. We will then demonstrate methods to efficiently reduce search space through the use of robust optimization constraints.  Real-world inverse problems can be expensive, thus we will show how to enable your optimization to seamlessly leverage parallel computing. Large-scale optimizations also can greatly benefit from efficient solver restarts and the saving of state. This tutorial will cover using asynchronous computing for results caching and archiving, dynamic real-time optimization, and dimensional reduction. Next we will discuss new optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform blazingly-fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Finally, we will close with applications of global optimization in statistics and quantitative finance.</value><value>The audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  We will introduce the </value><value>mystic</value><value> optimization framework – then begin with a walk through some introductory optimizations, learning how to build confidence in understanding your results. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive risk modeling.</value><value>PREREQUISITES</value><value>: This tutorial will assume attendees have basic knowledge of </value><value>python</value><value> and </value><value>numpy</value><value>, and is intended for scientific developers who are interested in utilizing optimization to solve real-world problems in statistics, quantitative finance, and predictive sciences.

Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques
as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation
for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.</value><value>Audience</value><value>: Programmers with good basic Python knowledge. No previous
knowledge in the field of optimization is required.</value><value>Objectives</value><value>: This tutorial will help you to get the most out of your optimization work.
You will learn useful techniques for details combined with an overall strategy
for the big picture.</value><value>Detailed Abstract</value><value>: Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?
This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one’s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.</value><value>The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.</value><value>Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.</value><value>More Info</value><value>: You will need Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.3 should also work. Very detailed installation instructions will be given to all participants well before the course.</value><value>Software requirements</value></description><tags><value>optimization</value><value>profiling</value></tags><title><value>Faster Python Programs - Measure, don't Guess</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Ben Nuttall</value></author><description><value>A workshop introducing participants to physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi.</value><value>Learn how to build applications with Python that interact with the physical world - using the Pi’s GPIO (general purpose input &amp; output) pins and its camera module and their respective Python libraries.</value><value>We’ll start simple - flashing LEDs, using push buttons, basic use of the camera module, then introduce sensors such as infra-red motion detectors, temperature sensors and light sensors, then we’ll build interactive applications (embedded apps, desktop apps and web apps) using the sensors and camera module for a variety of different purposes.</value><value>Embedded or physical computing is not just for C programmers or hardcore Linux engineers - I’ll show you how to get up and running with your first physical world application and show how easy it is to control GPIOs and the camera module from the language you know and love (and can read).

like to make better screen casts, scientific visualizations or slightly
less awful family/cat videos.
In the first part of the training, you will learn how to edit video footage, and create simple 2D animations with text and images, and how to embed animations from matplotlib and ggplot. The second part teaches you about the  Python interface to Blender, how operators work and how to use asyncio in Blender to achieve network programming without blocking the interface.</value></description><tags><value>3D</value><value>video</value><value>graphics</value><value>education</value><value>scripting</value><value>blender</value></tags><title><value>Blender for Pythonists</value></title></item><item><date><value>Wednesday 22 July</value><value>Wednesday 22 July</value></date><author><value>Francesc Alted</value></author><description><value>Many programming paradigms are reaching us nowadays bringing the promise of being faster by leveraging more cores and more machines (and more system administration headaches, but this is rarely stated).

Even though such unit tests may apparently cover all the code in a function, they might cover only a small subset of behaviours of the function. This potentially allows bugs such as heartbleed to stay undetected. Dynamic unit tests using fuzzing, which allows you to specify a data generation template, can make your test suite more robust.</value><value>In this talk, we demonstrate fuzzing using the hypothesis library.
Hypothesis is a Python library to automatically generate test data based on a template.
Data is generated using a strategy. A strategy specifies how data is generated, and how falsifying examples can be simplified. Hypothesis provides strategies for Python’s built-in data types, and is easily customizable.Since test data is generated automatically, we can not compare against pre-computed results. Instead, tests are usually done on invariants of functions. We give an overview of such invariants.</value><value>Finally, we demonstrate how we use fuzzing to test machine learning algorithms at Blue Yonder.</value></description><tags><value>unit-testing</value><value>hypothesis</value><value>fuzzing</value></tags><title><value>What's the fuzz all about?

Non-Blocking IO while doing tasks and not wait for IO. This also helps us handle a lot many connections than we possibly could with Blocking IO.

The profiler‘s use and results will be shown in the presentation with examples based on real-life applications.

Well, actually, it’s not a about writing tests, or writing them before the code. This talk will show you how to use tests to really drive development by transforming business requirements into tests, and allowing your code to come as their natural consequence.</value><value>Too often this key aspect is neglected and the result is that tests and code are somehow “disconnected”.

Supported backends include databases like Postgres or MongoDB, disk storage systems like PyTables, BColz, and HDF5, or distributed systems like Hadoop and Spark. </value><value>This talk will introduce the Blaze ecosystem, which includes: Blaze (data querying), Odo (data migration), Dask (task scheduler), DyND (dynamic, multidimensional arrays) and Datashape (data description).</value><value>Attendees will get the most out of this talk if they are familiar with NumPy and Pandas, have intermediate Python programming skills, and/or experience with large datasets.</value></description><tags><value>databases</value><value>open-source</value><value>datashape</value><value>pydata</value><value>distributed-systems</value><value>Abstractions</value><value>bigdata</value><value>analytics</value><value>dynd</value><value>blaze</value><value>odo</value><value>spark</value><value>data</value><value>numpy</value><value>dask</value></tags><title><value>Scale your data, not your process: Welcome to the Blaze ecosystem</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Juan Manuel Santos</value></author><description><value>SaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in Python that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no introduction.</value><value>This talk will cover a brief summary of why we need configuration management tools, followed by a full dive into SaltStack, its features, pros and cons, how to use it and how to extend it. By the end of this talk you will have gone from knowing little or nothing about SaltStack, to being able to deploy your own setup.</value><value>This talk will be targeted to either seasoned Python developers who are taking their first steps in the system administration world, or established system administrators who secretly love Python and prefer to stay away of configuration management systems based on other languages.
Its advisable that attendees have some familiarity with Python as well as with system administration concepts. Also, this presentation will be focused on GNU/Linux systems, so it is expected that attendees are comfortable with some of its concepts.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>saltstack</value><value>management</value><value>configuration</value><value>linux</value></tags><title><value>Salting things up in the sysadmin's world</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Brecht Machiels</value></author><description><value>Slides download link on the right. These include some </value><value>extra slides</value><value> (not shown during the presentation) which show some more of the internals of RinohType. They cover how the reStructuredText frontend is implemented and how page layouts are specified.</value><value>RinohType is a document processor inspired by [LaTeX][1] and written in Python. It renders [reStructuredText][2] and [Sphinx][3] documents to PDF based on a document template and a style sheet. RinohType already implements many of the features that make LaTeX so great. Not stopping there, RinohType also tries to fix LaTeX’s weaknesses; it should not only be easy to use, but easy to </value><value>customize</value><value> and </value><value>extend</value><value> as well. To minimize frustration when things go wrong, care is taken to provide descriptive warning and error messages. The powerful layout engine makes it easy to define custom page layouts. And the CSS-inspired stylesheets simplify the styling of document elements. At a lower level, Python makes the writing of extensions much more accessible when compared to TeX’s rather arcane macro language.</value><value>In the talk, I would like to introduce RinohType to the Python community. No special prerequisite knowledge is required.

By default, we use Ruby and Rails for projects. We also use Ruby-based projects for much of our tooling, including puppet, capistrano, and rake. However, we strongly believe in using the right tool for the job. What that means has evolved over ti
me, and I’ll discuss what solutions we chose in the past as well as our current choices.</value><value>So what’s it like doing Python at a Ruby shop? You get lots of jokes about language features Ruby has but Python lacks and lots of disbelief that Python will survive the 2/3 split. People also tend to apply the best practices and conventions of Ruby to Python code as if t
hey were the same. Python’s major inroad at Braintree has been, surprisingly enough, as a platform for high-concurrency situations. This is a direct result of the power of Tornado as a platform for asynchronous I/O. It also helps that many Python is very approachable and 
many developers have at least some experience with it.</value><value>Braintree has three pieces of our infrastructure using Python and Tornado – an incoming request proxy; an outgoing request proxy; and a webook delivery service. They’ve served us well for 3+ years but all suffer from a number of problems. The outdated concurrency feature
s of CPython / Python 2 as well as our lack of experience with and commitment to Tornado have always been an issue. As the meat of the talk, I’ll speak in depth about the other issues we’ve encountered with each of the three applications and our short- and long- term solu
tions to the problems.</value><value>The state as of the end of 2014 appeared dire for Python at Braintree. All the old Python code in our stack is on the way out, and Python has been specifically recommended agaist for new projects. Our Python client library is used by some of our largest merchants, and is 
ready for the future by supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+ in a single codebase. We also have a vibrant Python community at Venmo, our sister company. Both Braintree and Venmo support Python by attending, hosting, sponsoring, and speaking at meetups, conferences, and 
other events in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. At Braintree, our Data Science team uses Python almost exclusively and they’re becoming a bigger part of our business every day. We also use custom tooling written in Python to manage our infrastructure.</value></description><tags><value>data-science</value><value>pika</value><value>tornado</value><value>case study</value><value>collins</value><value>pandas</value><value>sklearn</value></tags><title><value>Python Not Recommended</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Hitul Mistry</value></author><description><value>In this talk, people will get introduced to python threading and multiprocessing packages.

It
is responsible for scheduling, distribution and monitoring applications which

cluster.</value><value>This Talk will give an overview of PySpark with a focus on Resilient
Distributed Datasets and the DataFrame API. While Spark Core itself is written
in Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to
Python. It defines an API for Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs are a
distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory
computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are immutable,
partitioned collections of objects. Transformations construct a new RDD from a
previous one. Actions compute a result based on an RDD. Multiple computation steps
are expressed as directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG execution model is 
a generalization of the Hadoop MapReduce computation model.</value><value>The Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark’s
RDD model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides
simplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large
datasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON
datasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.</value><value>Resources:</value></description><tags><value>analytics</value><value>data-science</value><value>bigdata</value><value>distributed-systems</value></tags><title><value>PySpark - Data processing in Python on top of Apache Spark.</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>James Robinson</value></author><description><value>A perspective of the impact of the PyconUK education track from the point of view of teachers and educators. </value><value>Having attended the education track at Pycon UK 2014 as a teacher, my talk will share both my experiences and those of other teachers attending.

Multibody simulation (MBS) requires two major steps: first the formulation of the specific mechanical problem. Second step is the integration of the resulting equations.
For the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very advanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports already Lagrange’s and Kane’s formalism. The extensions we made are such that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with several lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well known MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and constraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be added on top. The second step, the integration is done via ode-integrators implemented in scipy.
Finally for visual validation the results are visualized with the vpython package and for further analytics with matplotlib.</value><value>Conclusion: not only highly constrained pendulums with many rods and springs but also driving simulation of passenger cars an be performed with our new extension using python packages off the shelf.</value></description><tags><value>Mechanics</value><value>visualization</value><value>vpython</value><value>Engineering</value><value>scipy</value><value>sympy</value><value>education</value><value>Physics</value></tags><title><value>Multibody Simulation using sympy, scipy and vpython</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Dougal Matthews</value></author><description><value>MkDocs is a Python library for creating documentation with

“La metaprogramación consiste en escribir programas que escriben o manipulan otros programas (o a sí mismos) como datos, o que hacen en tiempo de compilación parte del trabajo que, de otra forma, se haría en tiempo de ejecución. Esto permite al programador ahorrar tiempo en la producción de código.”
En esta charla veremos diferentes mecanismos que Python proporciona como:
 - Decoradores
 - Metaclasses
 - Descriptors
A través de varios ejemplos veremos como reutilizar código en varias funciones y clases, como modificar como nuestras clases se generan, como se genera una clase (que funciones se llaman cuando una clase se crea) o como se genera una instancia.
Veremos también que fácilmente se nos puede ir de las manos y como utilizar con cuidado las herramientas que Python nos proporciona.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>metaclass</value><value>metaprogramming</value></tags><title><value>Metaprogramación en Python</value></title></item><item><date><value>Wednesday 22 July</value></date><author><value>Carles Bruguera</value></author><description><value>What if I told you that we’ve built an open source “WhatsApp”-like RESTful API on the top of Pyramid?

So why feel this only once every few weeks, why not feel it every day? In this talk I will show how we changed our workflow to automate deployment of code changes to production every time a feature is ready - sometimes even few times per day. I will present how to successfully combine open-source tools like Git, Jenkins, Buildout, Fabric, uWSGI, and South, in order to simplify the process and make it more reliable. I will discuss challenges that we faced implementing this workflow in a real project based on Django and how we resolved them.

However starting a new Python project can be tiring if you decide to stick to best practices and plan on submitting it to PyPI. It requires great diligence and occasionally gets pretty cumbersome if you start new tools on a regular basis.</value><value>Why not just use a template for it? Cookiecutter is a CLI tool written in pure Python that enables you to do so. Not only is it working for Python code, but also markdown formats and even other programming languages. We will talk about the ideas behind Cookiecutter and go over how you can create your very own template, so you and others can benefit from your experience.</value><value>I would like to briefly go into the technologies used and how you can get involved in the Cookiecutter GitHub project. There are already plenty of Cookiecutter templates, or Cookiecutters as we call them, available online. Most of them target Python projects, but others can be used to create C++, LaTeX or Javascript projects.</value><value>I will show you how to use Cookiecutter and highlight some of the amazing templates created by the community. More importantly we will create a Cookiecutter template from scratch using the example of a simple Kivy app and make use of advanced features such as post-gen hooks, copy-without-render and templates in context values.</value><value>Finally I will recommend resources on how to follow up on this talk and how to get in touch in case of any queries.</value><value>GitHub: </value><value>https://github.com/hackebrot</value><value>Twitter: </value><value>https://twitter.com/hackebrot</value><value>Blog: </value><value>http://www.hackebrot.de/</value></description><tags><value>Best Practice</value><value>open-source</value><value>community</value><value>Cookiecutter</value><value>pytest</value><value>Jinja2</value><value>cross-platform</value><value>Kivy</value><value>Click</value><value>CLI</value></tags><title><value>Come to the Dark Side!

The tools that we use (version control systems, IDEs, code analyzers) also use text as the primary storage format for code. In fact, the belief that “code is text” is so deeply ingrained in our heads that we never question its validity or even become aware of the fact that there are other ways to look at code.</value><value>In my talk I will explain why treating code as text is a very bad idea which actively holds back our understanding and creates a range of problems in large software projects. I will then show how we can overcome (some of) these problems by treating and storing code as data, and more specifically as a graph. I will show specific examples of how we can use this approach to improve our understanding of large code bases, increase code quality and automate certain aspects of software development.</value><value>Finally, I will outline my personal vision of the future of programming, which is a future where we no longer primarily interact with code bases using simple text editors.

As a case study, we’ll be looking at the backend powering the new Yelp Business Owner Android and iOS apps.</value><value>At the start, most of the development at Yelp occurred in a single, monolithic web application, creatively named “yelp-main” (naming is hard!). As the company grew, our developers were spending increasing amounts of time trying to ship code. After recognizing this pain point, we started experimenting with a service oriented architecture to scale the development process, and so far it’s been a resounding success. Over the course of the last three years, we’ve gone from writing our first service to having over seventy production services. Along the way, we’ve dabbled with Docker containers, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy, uWSGI, gevent, and virtualenv in an effort to build the next-generation service platform for our engineers.</value></description><tags><value>Pyramid</value><value>distributed-systems</value><value>REST</value><value>pytest</value><value>services</value><value>docker</value><value>swagger</value></tags><title><value>Building mobile APIs with services at Yelp</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Andrii Chaichenko</value></author><description><value>CeleraOne tries to bring its vision to Big Data by developing a unique platform for real-time Big Data processing.

We wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly found that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for handling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not want each team of developers working on individual business domains to have to handcraft their own SQL statements.
